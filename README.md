# DriveMind: Multimodal In-Vehicle AI Assistant

**An on-device co-pilot that sees the road, watches the driver, listens to the cabin, and reasons across all three in real time.**

DriveMind fuses three systems that today's cars keep separate:

- **ADAS-style road perception:** object detection, multi-object tracking, and monocular time-to-collision for forward-collision warnings.
- **Driver monitoring:** eye aspect ratio, PERCLOS, yawns, and head pose, used to detect drowsiness, microsleeps, and distraction.
- **A voice assistant with eyes:** streaming VAD → Whisper → a 4-bit vision-language model with tool calling, plus a CLIP-indexed visual memory so you can ask *"what did that sign say?"* after you've passed it.

A safety layer decides *when* the assistant may speak. It defers answers during hazards, shortens them under high workload, and starts a conversation when the driver gets drowsy.

Everything runs **on-device** on Apple Silicon (MLX + MPS). An optional **Claude** cloud brain handles harder questions, with automatic fallback to local when the network drops.

## Architecture

                                  router ─▶ Qwen2.5-VL-3B 4-bit (MLX, on-device)
                                        └▶ Claude (vision + tool use, optional)
                                  vehicle tools behind a deterministic safety envelope
```

Each stage runs on its own worker thread with **latest-frame-wins backpressure**, so a slow LLM answer can never delay a collision warning.

## Measured performance (MacBook, Apple Silicon, 24 GB)

| Stage | Latency |
|---|---|
| Road: YOLO11n + ByteTrack + TTC | 9–18 ms / frame |
| Driver: landmarks + trained eye-state model + PERCLOS/head pose | ~6.6 ms median / frame |
| Visual memory: CLIP keyframe embedding | ~18 ms |
| Speech recognition: Whisper turbo, 3 s utterance | ~0.5–0.6 s |
| On-device VLM answer (Qwen2.5-VL-3B, 4-bit) | ~1.6–2.2 s, decode ~110 tok/s |
| End of speech → spoken answer (fully local) | ~2.5 s |
| TTC accuracy vs. analytic ground truth | within 0.15 s (unit test); 0.01–0.17 s in end-to-end runs |

## Evaluation: driver eye-closure detection (Eyeblink8)

The driver monitor's eye-closure detector was evaluated on the public
[Eyeblink8](https://www.blinkingmatters.com/research) dataset (Fogelton & Benesova, 2016):
8 videos, 4 people, 71,748 frames, 408 hand-labelled blinks. Every number below comes from
**leave-one-person-out** cross-validation, so each person is scored by a model that never saw them.

| Method | Blink F1 | Closed-frame F1 | PERCLOS error (pts) | False microsleep alerts / h |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Textbook rule (EAR < 0.2) | 0.886 | 0.416 | 7.91 | 57.2 |
| Original calibrated-EAR rule | 0.907 | 0.497 | 4.48 | 33.1 |
| MediaPipe eyeBlink score (untrained fallback) | 0.911 | 0.843 | 0.41 | 0.0 |
| **Gradient-boosted trees, 13-frame window (trained, shipped)** | **0.949** | **0.867** | **0.56** | **0.0** |

The original rule's blink score looked fine, but it would have raised ~33 false microsleep
alerts per hour on people who were wide awake. The trained model is robust to its
threshold (F1 0.946–0.951, zero false microsleeps, for every threshold from 0.1 to 0.9), and
the live system reproduces the offline decisions frame-for-frame (`eval/verify_online.py`).
Full results, per-person breakdown and protocol: [eval/results/eyeblink8.md](eval/results/eyeblink8.md).

**Limits:** 4 people, 40 minutes of awake subjects at a desk. This measures eye-closure
detection, not drowsiness itself, which still needs a drowsy-driver dataset (UTA-RLDD, NTHU-DDD).

Reproduce (downloads 313 MB; the dataset and trained weights are GPL-3 derived, so they're git-ignored):

```bash
mkdir -p data && curl -L -o data/eyeblink8.zip https://www.blinkingmatters.com/files/upload/research/eyeblink8.zip
(cd data && unzip -q eyeblink8.zip && rm eyeblink8.zip)
.venv/bin/python -m eval.eyeblink8_extract   # MediaPipe features for 71k frames (~5 min)
.venv/bin/python -m eval.eyeblink8_eval      # LOPO evaluation + trains models/eye_state_gbm.joblib
.venv/bin/python -m eval.verify_online       # live DriverMonitor == offline pipeline
```

Without `models/eye_state_gbm.joblib`, the driver monitor falls back to MediaPipe's eyeBlink score.

## Evaluation: real drowsiness (UTA-RLDD)

Eyeblink8 only had awake people. To test actual drowsiness I used part of
[UTA-RLDD](https://sites.google.com/view/utarldd/home) (Ghoddoosian et al., CVPRW 2019):
6 participants (fold 3, part 2) who filmed themselves on their own phones/webcams for ~10 min
each while alert, low-vigilant and drowsy (self-reported on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale), 3.3 h in total.
**No RLDD data was used to train the eye model**, so this is an out-of-domain test.

**The shipped app, unchanged** (trained eye model + alert rules):

| Self-reported state | PERCLOS | Microsleep alerts / h | Drowsy alerts / h |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alert | 1.7% | 0.0 | 0.9 |
| Low vigilant | 4.7% | 15.8 | 3.0 |
| Drowsy | 9.0% | 65.8 | 16.4 |

Alerts rise with drowsiness and stay near zero for alert drivers. But per person, the app's
microsleep alerts fire more when drowsy for only **3 of 6** people. Some drowsy people barely close their eyes.

**Out-of-domain lesson:** MediaPipe's untrained eyeBlink score separated drowsy from alert better
(long eye closures per minute: ROC-AUC 1.00, higher when drowsy for 6/6 people) than the model
I trained on Eyeblink8 (AUC 0.94, 5/6). That model learned crisp blinks from four alert people;
drowsy eyes droop and close slowly.

**Trained drowsiness classifier** (1-minute windows of blink features, logistic regression,
leave-one-participant-out): **13/18 videos correct (72%, 95% CI 49–88%)**, alert-vs-drowsy
window ROC-AUC 0.95. On this fold the RLDD paper reports 70% for its HM-LSTM and 60% for human
judges, so we're on par. With 18 test videos the interval is wide, and this is not a claim of beating the paper.

**Controls:** frame rates differed between recordings (12–30 fps), so everything was re-run with
every video degraded to 12 fps; conclusions unchanged (classifier still 13/18, AUC 0.95).
Full tables: [eval/results/rldd_fold3_part2.md](eval/results/rldd_fold3_part2.md),
[12 fps control](eval/results/rldd_fold3_part2_fps12.md).

**Limits:** 6 people; labels are self-reported states for whole videos; people sat at home, not driving.

### Held-out test of a new alert rule (pre-registered)

The results above suggested alerting on *long* eye closures instead of PERCLOS. To avoid
fooling myself with 6 people, I chose the new rule using only those 6 development people (plus
Eyeblink8 as an awake-driver false-alarm check) and **committed it to git before processing
6 new people** (RLDD fold 5, part 1). See `eval/results/preregistration.json`, commits
`20c45c5`/`28e74f6`.

**Frozen rule:** alert when MediaPipe's eyeBlink score shows ≥ 4 eye closures of ≥ 0.5 s
within 60 s, or one closure ≥ 1 s.

| On 6 new people (3.4 h) | False alerts/h, alert videos | Drowsy videos alerted | People alerted more when drowsy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Previous rule (PERCLOS > 15% + microsleep) | 0.0 | 5/6 | 5/6 |
| **New rule (shipped)** | **0.0** | **5/6** | **5/6** |
| Exploratory: any closure ≥ 0.7 s | 2.0 | 6/6 | 6/6 |

- **Detection tied** on new people. The new rule's gain is false alarms: **zero** across all
  12 RLDD people and Eyeblink8's awake people, against one each for the previous rule. It met
  the pre-registered ship criterion, so it now drives the app's alerts
  (`drivemind/perception/drowsiness.py`). The live code makes the same alert/no-alert call
  as the offline rule on all 44 videos, at 30 fps and at the dashboard's 15 fps (`eval/verify_drowsiness_rule.py`).
- **Catching the last drowsy person costs ~2 false alarms per hour**, per the exploratory rule.
- **The drowsiness classifier did not generalize.** 72% in cross-validation on the 6 development people fell
  to **10/18 videos (56%, 95% CI 34–75%) on new people**, near human judges (58%) and below
  the paper's 65% (trained on 48 people). Not shipped.

Full table: [eval/results/rldd_heldout_test.md](eval/results/rldd_heldout_test.md).

### Second held-out test (pre-registered, 6 more unseen people)

Same frozen rules, no re-tuning, plan committed (`ff46dae`) before the data was downloaded
(RLDD fold 2, part 1, via a Kaggle mirror whose files match the official ones byte-for-byte).

| On 6 more new people (3.1 h) | False alerts/h, alert videos | Drowsy videos alerted | People alerted more when drowsy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Previous rule (PERCLOS > 15% + microsleep) | 4.1 | 4/6 | 3/6 |
| **Shipped rule** | **1.0** | **5/6** | **5/6** |
| Exploratory: any closure ≥ 0.7 s | 3.0 | 5/6 | 4/6 |

**Pooled over both held-out tests (12 unseen people, 6.4 h):**

| Rule | False alerts in 2.0 h of alert driving | Drowsy drivers caught (95% CI) |
|---|---|---|
| Previous rule | 4 | 9/12 (47–91%) |
| **Shipped rule** | **1** | **10/12 (55–95%)** |
| Exploratory | 5 | 11/12 (65–99%) |

The shipped rule is ahead on both detection and false alarms, but with 12 people the intervals
overlap heavily: consistent with an improvement, not proof of one. Two of the 12 drowsy drivers
barely closed their eyes at all, so no eye-closure rule caught them; that's the case for adding other cues.

**More training data helped the classifier, modestly:** trained on 6 people it scored 8/18 videos
(44%) on these new people; trained on 12 it scored 10/18 (56%, 95% CI 34–75%), window AUC 0.83 → 0.89.
That's still near human judges (58%) and below the paper's 65% (trained on 48 people), so it isn't shipped.
Results: [second test](eval/results/rldd_heldout_test_Fold2_part1.md), [pooled](eval/results/rldd_heldout_pooled.md).

## Quick start

**Requirements:** a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1 or newer; the speech and vision-language models
run on Apple's MLX framework), Python 3.11 (tested), about 9 GB of free disk (5 GB of models plus
packages), Chrome, and a webcam + microphone. `ffmpeg` (`brew install ffmpeg`) is only needed for
`scripts/e2e_check.py`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RuchirBhatia4/Multimodal-In-Vehicle-AI-Assistant.git
cd Multimodal-In-Vehicle-AI-Assistant
scripts/setup.sh      # one time: venv, dependencies, ~5 GB of model weights (~3 min with a fast connection)
scripts/run.sh        # every time; runs offline and opens the dashboard in Chrome when ready (~15-30 s)
```

The pills at the top of the dashboard turn green as each model finishes loading.
The dashboard (**http://127.0.0.1:8000**) opens by itself; allow camera and microphone access, then:

1. **Driver monitor:** your webcam is picked automatically. Look ahead for ~3 s while it calibrates to your eyes.
2. **Road camera:** click **Load dashcam video** and choose a driving clip: your own dashcam/phone footage, or a free-license clip (e.g. search "driving" on Pexels). Or pick a second camera.
3. **Talk:** hold **Space** (or the mic button) and ask:
   - "How many cars are ahead of us?" / "Is the light green?"
   - "I'm freezing, warm it up and play some jazz" (makes two tool calls)
   - "What did that sign say?" (searches visual memory)
   - "Open all the windows" with the speed slider above 55 mph (the safety envelope vents them instead)
4. Close your eyes for 2 s, or look away from the screen, to trigger the driver alerts.

**Optional:** put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` in `.env` to enable the Claude brain. *Auto* mode then routes complex questions to the cloud and falls back to on-device if it's unreachable.

## Safety note

DriveMind is a research prototype, not a certified safety system. Its warnings are advisory. The LLM never actuates anything directly: every vehicle action passes through deterministic validation.

## Roadmap

See [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md): dataset benchmarks (DMD, NTHU-DDD, DriveLM), lane detection, latency work (prefix caching, streaming TTS), a learned router, and porting perception to Jetson Orin / TensorRT.
