"""On-device brain: Qwen2.5-VL-3B, 4-bit quantized, running on Apple MLX.

Concepts:

* **Vision-Language Model (VLM) architecture.** A ViT image encoder turns the frame into
  patch embeddings, a projector maps them into the LLM's token space, and the LLM attends
  over image tokens and text tokens together. "Seeing" is just more tokens in the context.
* **4-bit weight quantization.** 3B params x 16 bits = 6 GB. At 4 bits (group-wise affine
  quantization: each group of 64 weights shares a scale + bias) that's ~2 GB, with a small
  quality loss. Decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound, so fewer bytes per weight is *directly*
  more tokens/sec. This is the single most important trick for edge LLMs.
* **Prefill vs. decode.** Prefill processes the whole prompt (incl. image tokens) in
  parallel and is compute-bound; decode generates one token at a time and is
  bandwidth-bound. We report both speeds so you can see which one dominates latency.
* **Prompted tool calling + constrained output.** Small local models don't have a native
  tool API, so we describe tools in the prompt and ask for JSON, then parse defensively.
  (Production systems use grammar-constrained decoding to *guarantee* valid JSON.)
* **Route deterministically where you can.** Simple rules (common.py) pick one of four paths:
  visual memory for questions about the past, a describe-only prompt for go/no-go safety
  questions, the tool prompt for car commands, and a plain look-and-answer prompt for
  everything else. Leaving these choices to the 3B model failed in measurable ways
  (eval/brain_qa_eval.py): it used memory for "which car is on my left?", copied example
  answers ("the light is green" at a red light), and said "it's safe to go".
