"""Question answering by the on-device brain, on real BDD100K frames with known answers.

Four checks, each motivated by a failure seen in the recorded demo or in this eval:
  A. Visual memory only for questions about the past ("Which car is on my left?" once
     answered from a frame 17 s old; past-tense questions sometimes skipped memory).
  B. Traffic-light colour on a clearly red and a clearly green frame. A prompt with example
     answers made the model copy them: "Is the light green?" -> "Yes, the light ahead is green."
     at a RED light. This catches copying; it doesn't measure light reading. On CURRENT, where
     the lights are a few pixels wide, the model calls the green lights red.
  C. Go/no-go questions must never be answered with "it's safe".
  D. Car commands still produce the right tool calls.
